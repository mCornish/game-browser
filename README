pulls data from the attached CSV of games and displays it on a searchable index page with individual result pages.
This is a small amount of data of course, but we’d like you to supplement this information with images and data pulled from the rawg.io API.
Here’s a link to the API: https://rawg.io/apidocs. Style the pages to fit to the design apparent on the kouch.io home page.
Use the same black color and main pink along with the secondary blue color and white text.
Bonus #1: Create a QR code to the rawg.io page for each game and display it on the game’s page.
Bonus #2: Display the names of notable streamers on Twitch and/or Facebook Gaming that play each game.
